# Decision Tree generator using Information Entropy

This creates a decision tree for classifying data, using the training data provided as XML and using information entropy to judge which attributes to use at each node of the tree.

## Usage

This is still very much in development so there's no UI at all yet. The repository in its current state will generate a decision tree for classifying movie data based on a set of sample movies (data is provided as XML.) The data input syntax is quite flexible if not verbose.

## Development

No documentation at all so far... sorry! The logic for displaying the tree is currently embedded in the constructor until I get round to make that a separate entity.

## Output

Currently, data output is presented through stdout as a simple visualisation. LaTeX output to follow soon.
